whats an int|||||In Java, the 'int' type is a primitive , whereas the 'Integer' type is an object.In C#, the 'int' type is the same as System.Int32 and is a value type (ie more like the java 'int'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed ("wrapped") into an object. The differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: Objects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap. Conversely, primitives are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the stack.
how do i compare string in java|||||== tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object) .equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically "equal").Objects.equals() checks for nulls before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava). Consequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().
